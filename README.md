Yifan Xia, Yifan Lu, Yuan Gao, and Jiayi Ma*. "Locality Preserving Refinement for Shape Matching with Functional Maps", in Proceedings of the Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Feb. 2024.

This paper focuses on the pointwise map recovery problem of functional maps in shape-matching. By embedding geometric constraints into the spectral domain, we propose a novel and effective method based on locality consistency, which has proven efficiency and accuracy.
